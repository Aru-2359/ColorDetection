# Color Detection using Python with OpenCV and Pillow ðŸ¦„

## Introduction ðŸš€

Color Detection using Python with OpenCV and Pillow is a simple yet powerful project that allows you to identify and extract specific colors from images. Whether you're a designer, photographer, or just curious about the colors in your pictures, this project can help you analyze and manipulate color information with ease.

The project leverages two popular Python libraries:

- **OpenCV**: A powerful computer vision library that provides various tools for image processing, including color manipulation and detection.
- **Pillow**: A user-friendly Python Imaging Library that allows you to open, manipulate, and save many different image file formats.

## Features âœ¨

- **Color Detection**: Detect and extract specific colors from an image by specifying their RGB values.
- **Color Visualization**: Visualize the detected color regions with bounding boxes and labels.
- **Export Results**: Save the color-detected image with bounding boxes for further analysis or sharing.

## Usage ðŸ‘»

1. **Specify RGB Values**:

   Enter the RGB values of the color you want to detect in the input fields provided in the GUI.

2. **Detect Color**:

   Click the "Detect Color" button to process the image and highlight regions that match the specified color.
